## About The Project

This project is an attempt to reproduce digital electronics in Python. Its **ultimate** goal is to be able to build an
actual CPU by simulating the core components of a real, physical, processor (using Transistors to build Logic Gates,
using Logic Gates to build a Half Adder, using Half Adders to build Full Adders, and so on and so forth...).

By adding more components to the project, you will be helping achieve that goal!



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics.git
   ```
2. Create the virtualenv
   ```sh
   virtualenv venv
   ```
3. Use it
   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install packages
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```



## Usage

The project is yet in its infancy, so there is not much to show for apart from some components.



## Coding Guidelines

This project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [Prospector](http://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/), and 
[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). It is set to enforce all the linting rules and 100% test coverage when running:
```sh
./run_tests.sh
```



## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known
issues).

It's tough to provide a real roadmap at this stage, since I'm still learning about digital electronics. Nonetheless,
there are a few concepts that should be thought about to allow the project to grow:

* **Memory**: All computers need memory. Whether D-Type FlipFlops, or SR Latches, we will need these components to build
more complex components...
  * ...such as [registers](https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics/issues/2)!
  * Speaking of memory... We need to build the [concept of time](https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics/issues/1)!
* **[Unified Interfaces](https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics/issues/3)**: It would be nice to have some utilities
baked into all the components that can give us some stats:
  * Number of Transistors in this component
  * Total Number of Transistors,
  * Timing functions to measure performance
  * Etc
* **[and more!](https://github.com/fgarci03/pylectronics/issues)**


## Contributing

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Do your magic
4. Make sure tests pass with 100% coverage, as well as static validation (`./run_tests.sh`)
5. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
6. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
7. Open a Pull Request
